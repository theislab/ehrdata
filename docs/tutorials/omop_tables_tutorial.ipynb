    "# OMOP Common Data Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronic health data is acquired and stored in many different manners. To facilitate the analysis of such data, and enable the joint analysis of multiple datasets, a common, widely applicable data model can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the OMOP Common Data Model is for. To put it in their words, from [The Book of OHDSI, Chapter 4: The Common Data Model](https://ohdsi.github.io/TheBookOfOhdsi/CommonDataModel.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Why do we need a Common Data Model for observational healthcare data?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Depending on their primary needs none of the observational databases capture all clinical events equally well. Therefore, research results must be drawn from many disparate data sources and compared and contrasted to understand the effect of potential capture bias. In addition, in order to draw conclusions with statistical power we need large numbers of observed patients. That explains the need for assessing and analyzing multiple data sources concurrently. In order to do that, data need to be harmonized into a common data standard. In addition, patient data require a high level of protection. To extract data for analysis purposes as it is done traditionally requires strict data use agreements and complex access control. A common data standard can alleviate this need by omitting the extraction step and allowing a standardized analytic to be executed on the data in it’s native environment - the analytic comes to the data instead of the data to the analytic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDM contains 16 Clinical Event tables, 10 Vocabulary tables, 2 metadata tables, 4 health system data tables, 2 health economics data tables, 3 standardized derived elements, and 2 Results schema tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we walk through the key aspects of the data model with some examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, we will use a [publicly available demo subsample of the MIMIC-IV dataset](https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo-omop/0.9/) containing 100 patients, converted to the OMOP CDM.\n"
